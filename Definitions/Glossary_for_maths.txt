99. Homogeneous

A homogeneous function is one with multiplicative scaling behaviour: if all its arguments are multiplied by a factor, then its value is multiplied by some power of this factor.
function that should be able to write in the form f(zx,zy) = z^n f(x,y). It means if we take f(x,y) function and replace both x and y by zx and zy then if we are able to write the equation in
the form defined above we call it homogeneous function. Ex. F(x,y) = x+y, Non homogeneous function = f(x,y) = x+y^2

102. Permutation matrices or signed permutation matrices or monomial matrices

A permutation matrix is a square matrix obtained from the same size identity matrix by a permutation of rows. Such a matrix is always row equivalent to an identity.
Every row and every column of a permutation matrix contain exactly one nonzero entry, which is 1.
There are two 2 × 2 permutation matrices:
[ 1 0
  0 1 ] ,
[ 0 1
  1 0 ] .

It means if we take 2x2 matrix then we can form 2 permutation matrix.
For 3x3 matrix we can form 6 permutation matrices.
There are six 3 × 3 permutation matrices. There are n! permutation matrices of size n.

103. Absolute value function

An absolute value function is a function that contains an algebraic expression within absolute value symbols.
The absolute value parent function, written as f(x)=|x|, is defined as

f(x)={x  if x>0
      0  if x=0
     -x  if x<0}
